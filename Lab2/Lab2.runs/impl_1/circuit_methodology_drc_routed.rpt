LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell inst_control/adder2_entry_a_reg[10]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) inst_datapath/adder2_entry_a_reg[10]/CLR, inst_datapath/adder2_entry_a_reg[8]/CLR, inst_datapath/adder2_entry_a_reg[9]/CLR, inst_datapath/adder2_entry_b_reg[10]/CLR, inst_datapath/adder2_entry_b_reg[8]/CLR, inst_datapath/adder2_entry_b_reg[9]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
